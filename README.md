**This repository contains my learning and understanding about git.**

*******************************************************************************************
Git is a Version Control tool...
***Version control sytem*** -- a system that records or manages changes to documents or computer programs over the time...</br>
VCS helps us tracking changes when multiple people works on the same project.</br>

Git is primarily used for source code management in software development.</br>

*Git life cycle* ----- ***[working directory]---------->[staging area]---------->[commit]***</br>
***WORKING DIRECTORY*** -- is where our project resides, that may or may not be tracked by git until we initialize that project repository or directory with git.</br>
***STAGING AREA*** -- After initialize, once we are in our working directory, we have to specify which file to be tracked by git, so for that we add files to staging area using git command.</br>
***COMMIT*** -- Once our files are selected and are ready in staging area, they can be saved in git repository, and saving a file in git repository is known as making a commit.</br>

Once the files are committed, they can be pushed to a remote repository such as Git</br>
All the commits made are bound to a branch.</br>
***BRANCH*** -- In Git, branch is like a copy of our project where we can make changes without affecting the main version. It's useful for working on new features or fixing bugs and errors.</br>
A branch always points to the latest commit made. The pointer to the latest commit is known as **HEAD**</br>

***For Git commands, I have created a separate file where all the important commands are mentioned.***</br>
Additionally, there is attached docs file with this git learning repo, where I have used Git commands in different assignments for practice and to better understand the workflow of Git.</br>
